# Data Structure Class Documentation

## Overview

### Description
- **High-Level Overview**: A data structure is an abstract representation for organizing and managing data efficiently, providing specific functionalities for various applications. Data structures can be implemented in multiple ways and may serve diverse purposes, from optimizing access times to sorting and searching.

- **Implementation Details**: Data structures vary significantly based on their purpose and use cases. They can be implemented using various techniques, including arrays, linked lists, trees, and specialized data structures like heaps or graphs.

### Strengths and Practical Use in Software Development
- #### Strengths:
  - Enhances data organization and access.
  - Optimizes specific operations (e.g., search, insertion, deletion) for various use cases.
  - Provides the foundation for algorithms and efficient problem-solving.
- #### Real-World Applications:
  - **Arrays**: Efficient storage and retrieval of elements with constant-time access.
  - **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data storage, especially for insertions and deletions.
  - **Stacks**: Managing function calls, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.
  - **Queues**: Task scheduling, resource management, and data buffering.
  - **Trees**: Organizing hierarchical data structures and searching (e.g., binary search trees).
  - **Graphs**: Modeling relationships between entities (e.g., social networks, maps).
  - **Hash Tables**: Efficient retrieval of values based on keys (e.g., dictionaries).
  - **Heaps**: Priority queues, scheduling, and efficient selection algorithms.
  - **Trie**: Searching for words and autocomplete functionality.
  - **Bloom Filter**: Data membership testing and spell checkers.
  - **Union-Find**: Disjoint set data structure for connectivity problems.
  - **Segment Tree**: Range query and update operations.
  - **Suffix Array**: Substring search and pattern matching.
  - **Skip List**: Fast search and insertion in sorted data.

## Design Principles

### Underlying Concepts
- **Concept**: A brief explanation of this concept
  - E.g. **FIFO**: FIFO, or First-In-First-Out, is a data management principle where the first item added to a collection is the first one to be removed or processed.
- **Concept 2**: Lorem ipsum...

## Implementation Overview

### Characteristics 
- **Storage**: Data structures define how data is stored and accessed.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Operations on data structures have associated time and space complexities.
- **Dynamic Size**: Many data structures can dynamically resize to accommodate varying data loads.
- **Comparisons**: Data structures often involve comparisons between elements or keys.
- **Customization**: Some data structures allow customization through user-defined functions or comparators.
- **Iteration**: Iterating through data structures may follow specific rules or orders.
- **Error Handling**: Data structures may implement error handling for invalid operations.

## Usage

### Initialization
To create an instance of a data structure, follow these steps:

```javascript
const dsInstance = new DataStructure(params: paramType);
```

<!-- Ex.  const dsInstance = new DataStructure(arg1: number | number[], arg2: 'example' | 'otherString', param3: object); -->
- `params: paramType` (Optional/Required): Initialization parameters specific to the data structure, which may include values, configurations, or custom settings.
    - Describe default values if optional

### Methods and Operations
A data structure provides various methods and operations. Below is a general template for documenting methods:

<!-- Ex.  dsInstance.methodName(arg1: number | number[], arg2: 'example' | 'otherString', param3: object); -->
- **Method Functionality ('Insert into dataStructure')**:
    - **Usage**: `dsInstance.methodName(param: paramType, paramTwo: paramType)`
    - **Description**: A brief description of what the method does.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `param1: paramType` (Optional/Required): Description of the first parameter.
          - Describe default values if optional
        - `param2: paramType` (Optional/Required): Description of the second parameter if applicable.
          - Describe default values if optional
    - **Return Value**: Description of the return value if applicable (unnecessary when `null`).

<!-- Leave this and tailor it to specific ds class being implemented -->
-  **Retrieve Class-Specific Help Object**
    - **Usage**: `dsInstance.help()`
    - **Description**: Displays class-specific help information in the console.
    - **Runtime Complexity**: `O(1)`
    
- Provide documentation for each method and operation offered by the specific data structure.

### Error Handling
- Describe how the data structure handles errors, invalid inputs, and potential edge cases. Specify any exceptions or error messages users should be aware of.
  - E.g. "Implements comprehensive input validation, rejecting incompatible data types with clear error messaging."
