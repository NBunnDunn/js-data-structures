/**
 * sandbox.js
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This file is a dedicated space for you to experiment with and manually test the 
 * data structure you are working on. Feel free to write and execute ad-hoc code 
 * here to understand how your implementation behaves and to conduct informal, 
 * exploratory testing.
 * 
 * How to Use:
 * - Import your data structure class at the top of this file.
 * - Write any code you want to test your data structure. 
 * - This is a great place for quick prototyping and debugging.
 * - Remember, code here is for your testing purposes and won't be included in the final tests.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * 1. Import your data structure (replace 'YourDataStructure' with the actual class name).
 *    const YourDataStructure = require('./src/YourDataStructure');
 * 
 * 2. Create an instance of your data structure.
 *    let dsInstance = new YourDataStructure();
 * 
 * 3. Perform operations like adding, removing elements, or whatever functionality your data structure supports.
 *    dsInstance.add('exampleElement');
 *    console.log(dsInstance);
 * 
 * Note:
 * - This file is meant for personal testing and should not be used for formal unit tests.
 * - If you find bugs or unexpected behavior while using this sandbox, consider adding formal test cases in the appropriate testing file.
 * - Feel free to clear or modify this file as needed for your testing.
 * - Before this file to .gitignore to avoid pushing personal test code to the main repository.
