/**
 * dataStructure.test.js
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This file is designed for writing and executing unit tests for the DataStructure class using Jest.
 * It provides a structured approach to ensure that the data structure is tested comprehensively.
 * 
 * Testing Requirements:
 * 1. Functionality Testing:
 *    - Method Testing: Verify behavior of each method for:
 *      a. Typical inputs (standard use cases).
 *      b. Atypical inputs (edge cases like very large or small numbers).
 *    - Boundary Conditions: Test behavior at input limits (e.g., full or empty structures).
 * 
 * 2. Error Handling and Edge Cases:
 *    - Invalid Inputs: Test responses to invalid or unusual parameters.
 *    - Edge Cases: Check behavior under extreme or unexpected conditions.
 * 
 * 3. State Preservation:
 *    - Consistency Checks: Verify the integrity and consistency of the data structure post-operations.
 * 
 * 4. Static Methods and Properties:
 *    - Utility Functions: Test for correct functionality of utility methods.
 *    - Documentation Methods: Ensure accuracy and usefulness of documentation-related methods.
 * 
 * Note on Testing Scope:
 * - Avoid testing external library features.
 * - Exclude trivial logic tests (like basic getters/setters) unless crucial.
 * - Prioritize tests based on their practical use and impact.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * - To test a method:
 *   describe('methodName', () => {
 *     test('should do something', () => {
 *       // Test code here
 *     });
 *   });
 * 
 *
