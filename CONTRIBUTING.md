## Understanding the Library Structure

### Folder Layout and Templates
The library is organized into categories, each containing specific data structures. Familiarize yourself with this structure to know where to contribute.

**`template` Folder:**
This folder provides detailed templates and guidelines for various files:
- **`src/DataStructure.js`**: The core file for data structure implementations.
- **`src/console-help.js`**: Provides console-based documentation for data structures.
- **`tests/DataStructure.test.js`**: Contains unit tests for each data structure.
- **`tests/sandbox.js`**: A playground for informal testing and debugging.

## Contributing Code

### Choose Your Task
Select a data structure to implement or enhance. Beginners may prefer simpler tasks, while experienced developers can tackle more complex ones.

### Implementation and Coding Style
Make your changes in the respective files, adhering to the existing coding style for consistency.

## Testing Your Code

### Writing Tests
Create tests in the `DataStructure.test.js` file. Refer to `template/tests/DataStructure.test.js` for test scope and expectations.

### Sandbox Experimentation
Use `sandbox.js` for testing and experimentation. Details can be found in `template/tests/sandbox.js`.

## Documentation

### Documenting Your Work
- Provide extensive documentation for each data structure in `DataStructure.md`.
- Include console-based documentation in `console-help.js`.
- Maintain clear in-line comments in `DataStructure.js`.

**Templates:** For documentation guidelines, refer to `template/DataStructure.md` and `template/src/console-help.js`.
