# Comprehensive JavaScript Data Structure Library

## Overview
Welcome to the Comprehensive JavaScript Data Structure Library. This extensive collection features a variety of data structures implemented in JavaScript, from basic to advanced. Designed for educational purposes, it offers efficient and tested implementations in a modular format. Whether you're tackling complex algorithms, optimizing applications, or exploring data structure concepts, this library is an invaluable resource.

**This library is particularly beginner-friendly with a range of implementations from basic to advanced levels. It's particular helpful for:**
- Beginners, looking to:
  - **Gain firsthand experience** with version control systems like Git, contributing to open-source projects, and understanding the workflow of collaborative software development.
  - **Build upon a portfolio**, showcasing practical skills to potential employers or for personal growth.
  - **Practice robust algorithm development**, ultimately learning how to write bug-free code.
  - **Hone test-driven-development skills** skills and become more familiar with unit-testing.
- Students, looking to:
  - **Reinforce academic concepts** by implementing and understanding a variety of data structures.
  - **Prepare for the technical interview** by having access to an extensively documented and robust library of both common and more advanced data structures
- Developers looking to: 
  - **Sharpen their skills** by reimplementing both classic and more challenging data structures
  - **Give back to the community** by sharing knowledge and contributing to educational resources

## For Beginners
If you're new to open-source projects, this library is a great starting point. We've structured it to be welcoming and inclusive for contributors of all skill levels. Here you'll find:

- A `template` folder to guide your contributions.
  - This folder contains all required content associated with the implementation of a data structure, with each file clearly outlining the expected contents and examples at every step.
- Detailed documentation to help you understand each data structure, both in the form of an extensive markdown file for each data structure as well as a set of console-based tutorials for  data structure and its methods.
- A variety of data structures, from basic to advanced, providing opportunities to learn and grow.
- A supportive community that's eager to help newcomers.

We encourage you to try implementing a data structure, improving documentation, or adding tests. Every contribution is valuable!

## Library Structure
Each data structure folder contains (at a mininum):
- Source code for the data structure (`src` folder)
  - `DataStructure.js`: The main file for each data structure
  - `logger.js`: The file which contains all console-based tutorials and information for each data structure
- Various forms of testing (`tests` folder)
  - `DataStructure.test.js`: Location of extension unit tests specific to each data structure
  - `sandbox.js`: An interactive sandbox file for experimentation
- Comprehensive documentation (`DataStructure.md`)

## Library Content
The library is organized into subfolders, each dedicated to a major category of data structures, with implementations of specific types within each category. **Note**: Not every data structure listed below has been added, those marked with a "âœ…" are already implemented, while those marked with a "ðŸš§" are planned for future implementation:

- **Linked Lists**: 
  - ðŸš§ Singly Linked List
  - ðŸš§ Doubly Linked List
  - ðŸš§ Circular Linked List

- **Stacks**: 
  - ðŸš§ Array-Stack 
  - ðŸš§ Linked-List-Stack

- **Queues**: 
  - ðŸš§ Simple Queue (Basic FIFO implementation)
  - ðŸš§ Circular Queue (Efficient for fixed-size queues)

- **Heaps**: 
  - âœ… Binary Heap
    - âœ… PriorityQueue (Using a BinaryHeap)
  - ðŸš§ Fibonacci Heap (Better amortized performance)
  - ðŸš§ Binomial Heap (Efficient for merging)

- **Trees**: 
  - Binary Trees
    - ðŸš§ Standard Binary Tree
    - ðŸš§ Binary Search Tree
  - Balanced Trees
    - ðŸš§ AVL Tree (Self-balancing tree)
    - ðŸš§ Red-Black Tree (Balances after insertions and deletions)
    - ðŸš§ B-Tree (Optimized for reading and writing large blocks of data)
    - ðŸš§ Splay Tree (Moves frequently accessed elements closer to the root)

- **Tries**: 
  - ðŸš§ Simple Tries (Efficient for word retrieval)
  - ðŸš§ Suffix Tries (Useful for substring searches)
  - ðŸš§ Radix Tries (Compressed trie for space efficiency)

- **Graphs**: 
  - ðŸš§ Directed (For representing directed relationships)
    - ðŸš§ Weighted (Graphs with weighted edges)
  - ðŸš§ Undirected (For representing bidirectional relationships)
    - ðŸš§ Weighted (Graphs with weighted edges)

## Usage
To use a specific data structure in your project, simply navigate to the respective folder and include the source file in your JavaScript application. Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in the `DataStructure.md` file within each subfolder.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Comprehensive JavaScript Data Structure Library are welcome! Whether it's adding new structures, optimizing existing ones, or improving documentation, your input is valuable. Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on contributing.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and explore the various data structures available. Each subfolder contains a standalone implementation, along with its documentation and tests.
